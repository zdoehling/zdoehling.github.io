		<h1>Guidelines</h1>
		<p>During my undergrad, we were tasked with creating an identity manual for either a fictional airline or rebranding an existing one. The identity manual would include each of these aspects alongside a brief explanation of my thought process:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Identity on the Airplane</li>
					<li>Basic Stationary</li>
					<li>Web site and Smartphone application interface </li>
					<li>Interactive Kiosk</li>
					<li>Airline Counter</li>
					<li>Advertisements</li>
					<li>Boarding Pass</li>
					<li>Luggage Tags</li>
					<li>Signs &amp; Vehicles</li>
				</ul>
		<h1>Research</h1>
	  <p>I began researching major airline business models in the United States. Along the way, Spirit jumped out to me because of all the negative press that is associated with their name- I figured they could use a rebranding the most. To present my research to my peers in an oral presentation, I created <a href="sourceImages/soarSouth/spiritResearch.pdf" target="_blank">this presentation</a> to highlight the main aspects of my findings. A key player I found was what appeared to be a disconnect in the expected user experience of flying and the experience offered by Spirit, so many customers would leave feeling dissatisfied. After looking into the negativity surround Spirit, I compared their business to successful European low-fare airlines to figure out what made airlines such as Ryan Air work so well. </p>
		<p>Through this process, I found that I would change so much of Spirit’s business model (airplane model, airports, flightpath) it would make more sense to simply create my own airline business strategy. </p>
		<!-- Very Long Research Explination 
			<p> The very first step was looking into existing airlines and their business models. I began by thinking of airline branding I recognize within the United States. Having flown Delta a few times it makes sense that they were the first to come to mind, but I was interested in other airlines whose brand I could recall even though I had never done any business with them before. Brands such as American Airlines, Jet, Southwestern, Alaskan, Spirit, and United were still recognizable to me on their advertising and branding alone. </p>
			<p>Of the recognizable brands, Spirit and United were two major airlines that I could recall having a negative impression through poor press, such as the United Airlines assault on their passenger, or simply negative word of mouth. Being a college student who loves to travel, my personal impediment is simply the cost of flying being too high for what little resources I have, so the brand Spirit, who is known for having cheap seats, was the most interesting to me.</p>
			<p>To synthesize my research of Spirit’s business strategy I created this document to assist with my oral presentation to my peers. The focus of the presentation was there appeared to be a disconnect with Spirit’s business strategy and how they were able to portray themselves to their consumers. This created an issue where flyers didn’t know what to expect and would often be dissatisfied with the level of service that was provided.</p>
			<p>Throughout the entire design process, I continued to be a student of research with each solution I created to ensure that I was creating quality work. This research drove me to analyze why European airlines, such as Ryan Air or Easy Jet, are very successful discount airlines as opposed to Spirit being one of the least popular airlines in America. As I combined aspects of these European airline strategies I realized that I would be changing so much about the Spirit business strategy it made more sense to create my own separate airline.</p> -->

	  <h1>Design Process</h1>
			<p>My first order of business was to create a logo with an icon I could carry across all aspects of my branding and a restriction of colors and logo uses to ensure a consistent style across all assets. This was a long process to trial and error and refinement going through many directions. </p>

			<h5 class="imgCap">The Illustrator file I used to select and refine the logo</h5>
			<p>Once I had achieved a strong logo, I was ready to dive into creating all the assets. Throughout this entire design process, I would continue my research to learn as much as I could about an unfamiliar industry and ensure that each design was a well educated solution.</p>
			<h1>My Takeaway</h1>
			<p>Creating Soar South required extensive research in a field I was very new too. While having been a customer on an airline, designing an entire identity around a business model within about a month’s timespan took a lot of thought and effort, but showed that understanding the industry you are designing for is critical. The entire experience also provided an opportunity to grow knowledgeable with many different aspects of corporate design. Moving forward, I plan to use this experience through continuing to ask questions and gain depth of understating for whatever industry I find myself designing.</p>
